This is Deepa Baby.This is my capstone project front end part using React JS. 
My final capstone project is to let users register and login to a forum so that they can view a list of categories, create questions and answers for each category. 
The main page contains the title of the app, logout link.The logout link will transfer the user back to the login page.
On the left, there is a menu of the existing categories. 
Upon selecting a category, the "select a Category to get started" area is replaced by questions.
When clicking the Create New Question button, user can create a question.
When  clicking a Question link,user can view its contents .In the question view user can see the details 
of the question and the list of answers.
